        <h2>Specification</h2>
        <p class='lead'>
          CBOR is specified in a Standards-Track RFC.
          RFCs that serve as Internet Standards Documents are generated by the
          <a href='https://ietf.org'>IETF</a>
          based on an extensive technical review and quality control process.  These are meant to last.

          <h2>IANA registry</h2>
          <p>
            CBOR has been designed to be extensible by enabling third parties to define Tags.
            Immediately after CBOR was published, extensions started to be documented.
            Those that are completed are collected in an
            <a href='https://iana.org'>IANA</a>
            registry to ensure specifications are available and that they don't stumble over each other.

            Unfortunately, even in the age of comprehensive continuous integration we make
            <a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=7049'>silly mistakes.</a>
            However, RFCs never change.
            Just in case silly mistakes irk you as much as us, two editorial mistakes that have been found so far are corrected in this updated copy of
            RFC 7049:
